## Namma ChatOn

Namma ChatOn is a simple chat service which has features to translate the incoming messages into user prefered native language in a real time. The basic idea of the app is to eliminate the language barrier between the users communication. The user can wish to communicate with his/her own language while the other can recieve in his/her own language. This app has a wider scope to improvise in supporting multiple source and translation language.
